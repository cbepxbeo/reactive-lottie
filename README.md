# Rective Lottie animations for SwiftUI. 

The package is based on [lottie-ios](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-ios). 

Package does not depend on it, and you will not get conflicts when using it.  
The logical part, types and extensions have been modified to be compatible with `SwiftUI`.  
  
<b>See example for reference.</b>
